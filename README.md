## Install

Clone this repository and run
```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Update ``config.json``. An example of one is in the examples folder.
2. In the terminal, run
```sh
node index.js
```
This will spawn the single bot ``BossMazeBot`` that listens to your commands. The ``BuilderMazeBot(s)`` the bot(s) that will actually build the maze spawn when you run a command.  
3. Create a flat land for the maze. Position the ``BossMazeBot`` on the ground at the northwest corner of where you want the maze to be built.  
4. Run the command to build the maze of height (z-axis in Minecraft) H and width (x-axis in Minecraft) W. 
```sh
buildMaze H W
```
#### Example
```sh
buildMaze 17 17
```

#### Optional argument 
The default block used to build the maze is ``oak_leaves``, but an optional argument can be used to specify the block used.  
Example 
```sh
buildMaze 17 17 stone
```

#### Recommended usage
It is recommended to use odd numbers for the height and width. When even numbers are used, the edges are padded, creating unpleasant mazes such as below.
```sh
buildMaze 16 17
```
